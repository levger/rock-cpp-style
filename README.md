# ROCK CPP Style

These are [Clang Format Style Options](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html)
based on the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
and adapted to be compatible with the conventions used in the
[ROCK Robotics Framework](https://www.rock-robotics.org/).

It was primarily created for ESA and partner institutions, and hopefully it
helps more people in the ROCK community as a starting point.
